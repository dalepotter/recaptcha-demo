# reCAPTCHA v3 Token Generator Demo

A simple frontend demo to generate reCAPTCHA v3 tokens that can be verified using the Google reCAPTCHA API.

## What is reCAPTCHA v3?

reCAPTCHA v3 is Google's invisible CAPTCHA solution that returns a score (0.0-1.0) for each request without user interaction. It helps you detect abusive traffic on your website without friction.

- **Score 1.0**: Very likely a good interaction
- **Score 0.0**: Very likely a bot

Unlike reCAPTCHA v2, v3 runs in the background and doesn't interrupt users with challenges.

## Prerequisites

To use this demo, you'll need:

- A Google account
- A registered site with reCAPTCHA v3 credentials

Get your reCAPTCHA keys at: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin

## Setup

### 1. Register Your Site with reCAPTCHA v3

1. Go to the [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Click the **+** button to register a new site
3. Fill in the registration form:
   - **Label**: Give your site a name (e.g., "reCAPTCHA v3 Demo")
   - **reCAPTCHA type**: Select **reCAPTCHA v3**
   - **Domains**: Add both (without `http://` or `https://` prefix):
     - `localhost` - for local testing
     - `<your-username>.github.io` - for GitHub Pages deployment
   - **Accept the terms** and click **Submit**
4. You'll receive two keys:
   - **Site Key** (public) - Used in the frontend
   - **Secret Key** (private) - Used for verification API calls

### 2. Configure the Site Key

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find this line near the bottom:
   ```html
   <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?render=YOUR_SITE_KEY"></script>
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_SITE_KEY` with your actual site key from step 1
4. Save the file

### 3. Local Testing

You can run this demo locally in several ways:

**Option A: Direct File Access**
- Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
- Note: Some browsers may restrict reCAPTCHA on `file://` protocol

**Option B: Local HTTP Server (Recommended)**

Using Node.js:
```bash
# Install http-server globally (one-time)
npm install -g http-server

# Run server
http-server -p 8000

# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

Using Python:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8001

# Then visit: http://localhost:8001
```
